This project is a console-based banking application developed in Java, ideal for coding beginners. It introduces fundamental programming concepts such as using the Scanner class for input, strings, loops, methods, and conditional statements.

The application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

Deposit: Add money to an account.
Withdraw: Subtract money from an account, with validation to prevent overdrafts.
Check Balance: Display the current balance in the account.
Exit: Safely exit the program when the user is finished.
Key Concepts Covered:

Scanner class for capturing user input.
Methods for modularizing code (e.g., for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking).
Conditional statements to handle logic like checking if there are sufficient funds for withdrawal.
Loops to allow continuous user interactions until they choose to exit the application.
This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand basic Java syntax and logic while working on real-world inspired problems.
